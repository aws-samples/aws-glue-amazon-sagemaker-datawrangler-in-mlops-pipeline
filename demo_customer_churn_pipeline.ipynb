    "Amazon SageMaker Model Building Pipelines offers machine learning (ML) application developers and operations engineers the ability to orchestrate SageMaker jobs and author reproducible ML pipelines. It also enables them to deploy custom-build models for inference in real-time with low latency, run offline inferences with Batch Transform, and track lineage of artifacts. They can institute sound operational practices in deploying and monitoring production workflows, deploying model artifacts, and tracking artifact lineage through a simple interface, adhering to safety and best practice paradigms for ML application development.\n",

This DSL defines a directed acyclic graph (DAG) of pipeline parameters and SageMaker job steps. The SageMaker Python Software Developer Kit (SDK) streamlines the generation of the pipeline DSL using constructs that engineers and scientists are already familiar with."

    "\n",
    "SageMaker Feature Store is a SageMaker capability that makes it easy for customers to create and manage curated features for machine learning (ML) development. It erves as the single source of truth to store, retrieve, remove, track, share, discover, and control access to features. SageMaker Feature Store enables data ingestion via a high TPS API and data consumption via the online and offline stores.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Terminology\n",
    "* `Feature group` – A FeatureGroup is the main Feature Store resource that contains the metadata for all the data stored in Amazon SageMaker Feature Store. A feature group is a logical grouping of features, defined in the feature store, to describe records. A feature group’s definition is composed of a list of feature definitions, a record identifier name, and configurations for its online and offline store. \n",
    "\n",
    "* `Feature definition` – A FeatureDefinition consists of a name and one of the following data types: an Integral, String or Fractional. A FeatureGroup contains a list of feature definitions. \n",
    "\n",
    "* `Record identifier name` – Each feature group is defined with a record identifier name. The record identifier name must refer to one of the names of a feature defined in the feature group's feature definitions. \n",
    "\n",
    "* `Event time` – a point in time when a new event occurs that corresponds to the creation or update of a record in a feature group. All records in the feature group must have a corresponding Eventtime. It can be used to track changes to a record over time. The online store contains the record corresponding to the last Eventtime for a record identifier name, whereas the offline store contains all historic records.\n",
    "\n",
    "* `Online Store` – the low latency, high availability cache for a feature group that enables real-time lookup of records. The online store allows quick access to the latest value for a Record via the GetRecord API. A feature group contains an OnlineStoreConfig controlling where the data is stored.\n",
    "\n",
    "* `Offline store` – the OfflineStore, stores historical data in your S3 bucket. It is used when low (sub-second) latency reads are not needed. For example, when you want to store and serve features for exploration, model training, and batch inference. A feature group contains an OfflineStoreConfig controlling where the data is stored."
